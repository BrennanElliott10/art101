				<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our goal was to incorporate JavaScript into a webpage describing a car
					we either own or want to own.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was not extremely difficult. Java Script is extremely
					forgiving which is very helpfull in making the lab easier. The most
					challenging part is still trying to get CSS to do exactly what I want
					but, it will get easier with practice.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I am satisfied with the results of this lab. I feel lie I learned a
						lot especially with Javascript.</p>
