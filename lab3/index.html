			<h1>
				Lab 3 File Structure
			</h1>

				<p>
				In lab 3, we were tasked with uploading files and formatting our websites.
				</p>

			<h1>
				Challenges
			</h1>

				<p>
					This should have been somewhat easy.
					However, we ran into quite a bit of trouble. To start, I (Solomon) was
					rushed to try and get it done before 1:00pm, because I had work from
					1-10 Wednesday. On top of that, we had a bit of difficulty understanding
					what we needed to screenshot at first. However, after discussing it with
					one another, we realized what we needed to do. I wanted to spend more
					time working on this, but I had called in sick enough the last few weeks,
					so I couldn't afford to take any more sick time off.
				<p/>

			<h1>
				Result
			</h1>

				<p>
					This doesn't take away from I am proud of the results we did achieve.
					I just wanted to make the website look much cleaner than it does right now.
