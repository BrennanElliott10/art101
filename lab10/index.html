			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					Our challenge was to create an input box that allows the user to input their name so it could be sorted.
				</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					THERE WERE A LOT OF PROBLEMS. This was our first time truly diving
          into javascript, and I made a lot of syntax errors. I couldn't even
          turn in the assignment, I had made so many mistakes. However, Brock
          helped me a ton during section and helped me understand the syntax
          errors and how to fix them. All my code was right, just formatted incorrectly.
				</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
					Try out the function for yourself!
