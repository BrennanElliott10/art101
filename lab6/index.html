	<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>We were challenged with cosing arrays and objects into our
				JavaScript.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We were able to do this lab somewhat easily after looking back
				at our notes and the slides from lecture. Solomon has previous experience
				working with Python which is different from JavaScript so the transition
				was harder than learning it for the first time.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I am happy with the result of our work. It feels good when the
				code we worked on actually shows up on the website. I would like to learn
				how to get rid of the moustache brackets on the "myMainRide" output.</p>
