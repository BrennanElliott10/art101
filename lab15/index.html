            <h2 class="header">Problems</h2>
            <p>This was a pretty difficult lab to complete. We ran into many
              problems while working on it like not being able to access the
              api because it was blocked and not being able to print anything
              useful in the output box.</p>
            <h2  class="header">Results</h2>
            <p>This lab was one of the hardest we have had to do so far.
              Communicating through Slack and Discord Solomon and I tried for a
              few hours to figure out how to complete it on our own before
              eventually rewatching the lecture to see what we were missing.
              We ended up heavily relying on Wes’s code to get something that
              worked. After trying the Pokemon API for a while we decided to
              use the NASA API because that is what our classmates recommended
              on discord. We still can’t get the image to show up but we were
              able to get the title which was unnecessarily hard.</p>
