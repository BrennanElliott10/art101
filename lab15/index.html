            <h2 class="header">Problems</h2>
            <p>This was a pretty difficult lab to complete. We ran into many
              problems while working on it like not being able to access the
              api because it was blocked and not being able to print anything
              useful in the output box.</p>
            <h2  class="header">Results</h2>
            <p>For the most part the page seems to be working, especially in t
              he console. We just need to figure out how to get it to print
              something other than "undefined" in the output div.</p>
