            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>We were challenged to manipulate DOM elements in our
            JavaScript</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>At first this was a struggle like most of the labs have been.
            The main issue was that the "appendChild" wasn't printing the
            variable on the site but,after reviewing the slides from lecture and
            our notes we were able to figure out how to manipulate our DOM
            elements pretty easily and get them to act the way we wanted.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>It is always very satisfying when you get to a point where your
              code actually works and shows up on your website and once we
              worked past our struggles and got to that point we were proud of
              the results.</p>
