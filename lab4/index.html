		<h1>Objective</h1>

		<p>
			 We were challenged with pseudocoding a task we would like to accomplish
			 on our computer through Java Script.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class= "description">
		<h1>Problems</h1>

		<p>
			With this lab we did not encounter any challenges. While we are both busy
			outside of school, we were able to find enough time to work on
			the lab and complete it successfully.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class= "description">
		<h1>Results</h1>

		<p>
			We Decided that we wanted to code	a screen where a logo bounces from
			border to border infinitely like the DVD pause screen. This is what our psuedocode looks like.
