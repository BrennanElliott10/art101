            <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>We were challenged to create a function that takes user input.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>Working with functions overall was very difficult but, after enough
              time we were able to figure it out to some degree. At first our HTML
              was acting weird and wouldn't let us link our JavaScript. After trying
              different things refreshing atom ended up working. This was an annoying
              set back at first but, it was somewhat easy to overcome.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>There is a lot more I would like to do with this lab but it was
              very hard to understand what we have right now. So far it is not
              the most impressive function out there but, I plan on working on
              it until it is better.</p>
